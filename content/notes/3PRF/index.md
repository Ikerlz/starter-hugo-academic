## 1. Introduction

- How to use the vast predictive information to forecast important economic aggregates like national product or stock market value.
  - If the predictors number near or more than the number of observations, the standard OLS forecaster is known to be poorly behaved or nonexistent (Huber, 1973)


- **Contributions**

  1. develop asymptotic theory for the 3PRF
  2. verify the finite sample accuracy of the asymptotic theory
  3. compare the 3PRF to other methods
  4. provide empirical support for the 3PRF's strong forecasting performance
