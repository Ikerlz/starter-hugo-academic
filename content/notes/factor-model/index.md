## 0. Background

## 1. Introduction

- Factor model in balanced panel has been thoroughly investigated.
- How to handle the missing data problem in factor models ?
  - the expectationâ€“maximization (EM) algorithm
  - the Kalman filter (KF)
- There is no formal study of the **asymptotic properties** for the EM estimators of the factors and factor loadings for the PC estimation with <mark>missing observations</mark>
